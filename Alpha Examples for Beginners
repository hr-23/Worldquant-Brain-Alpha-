Alpha Examples for Beginners
Volatility arbitrage
Hypothesis

If the ratio of a stock’s implied volatility from a 120-day call option to 120 day Parkinson volatility is higher compared to other stocks, the stock price would increase. (Note that implied volatility looks 120 days in the future, while Parkinsons volatility looks at 120 days in the past)

Implementation

Long the stock if its implied volatility significantly exceeds its historical volatility and short the opposite

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can using transformational operators on the expression improve performance?

Momentum after news
Hypothesis

After news is released, if a stock takes a longer time to rise, it may show strong evidence of upward momentum, and it could be beneficial to take a long position in it.

Implementation

Use the data field 'nws12_prez_4l' to capture this hypothesis. Backfill it with two years of data to ensure there is no drop in coverage

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can increasing weight on more liquid stocks (Stocks with high volume) help pass the sub-universe test?

EBIT vs CAPEX
Hypothesis

Stocks with higher EBIT compared to CapEx can be a sign of the company not investing much in growth and the stock may not grow as much, thus we should sell those stocks.

Implementation

CapEx (capital expenditure) is money spent on acquiring/maintaining fixed assets. Compare CapEx with EBIT, which is a company's net income before interest and taxes, and short stocks with inadequate CapEx.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can different neutralization settings improve the alpha performance?

Future Investment and Dividend
Hypothesis

Retained Earnings is a measure of a firm's net income that it has accrued over time and saved after the distribution of dividend. So Retained Earnings are an indicator of the capability of future investment and dividend.

Implementation

Use sharesout to normalize the amount of retained earnings; then apply ts_delta() operator to capture the change of the ratio over the last three months (one quarter). Finally use rank() operator to normalize the result.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Think about how many trading days in one quarter. Maybe there are less than 90 trading days in three months.

rank(ts_delta(retained_earnings / sharesout, 90))

Room for growth
Hypothesis

Companies with high asset fair value but comparatively lower EBIT are likely companies that have invested for growth over the past years and have more room for growth in the future

Implementation

Rank domestic and foreign EBIT separately with grouping by industry, because different industries may have different splits between domestic and foreign EBIT. Set lower alpha signal for companies with lower asset fair value.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can the alpha work well if comparing among companies that are already more sizeable (TOP500), because companies that are too small may consider this metric as too risky as it is a sign of lower cashflows.

123
alpha = -group_rank(fnd2_ebitdm, industry)-group_rank(fnd2_ebitfr, industry);group_rank(fn_assets_fair_val_a,industry)>0.5?alpha*2 : alpha

Pay back the debt
Hypothesis

It is usually safer to go long on companies that can easily pay back the short term debt using high liquid assets.

Implementation

Zscore of the ratio between cash and short term debt is calculated with higher readings refer to higher ratio when compared with the market.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Try comparing a stock with its peers instead of the whole market.

Retained earnings
Hypothesis

Retained earnings are the cumulative net earnings of a company after dividend payments to the shareholders. In certain situations, shareholders might want to receive their dividends and realize their profit. Thus, some shareholders might not be happy with excessive retained earnings.

Implementation

We should long the stock that has its retained earnings decreasing and vice-versa.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can different neutralization setting improve the alpha performance?

Pretax Income
Hypothesis

Pretax income is a good measure of a company's financial health and profitability. Companies with increasing pretax income may have good growth prospects and higher potential for increasing stock price. Thus, we would long stocks with increasing pretax income and short stocks with decreasing pretax income.

Implementation

Use the time-series rank operator to compare the trend of pretax income over the past 2 years, and use the quantile operator to normalize the result.

Hints to Implement

Boost the signal with sales data. For example, if the company has higher sales, it is more likely to outperform.

Operating Earnings Yield
Hypothesis

If the operating income of a company is currently higher than its past 1 year history, buy the company’s stock and vice-versa.

Implementation

Using ts_rank to identify current performance of the company compared to its own history

Hints to Implement

Rather than comparing the value directly, can calculating a ratio that includes stock market moves, improve the signal?

Appreciation of liabilities
Hypothesis

An increase in the fair value of liabilities could indicate a higher cost than expected. This may deteriorate the company's financial health, potentially leading to lower profitability or financial distress.

Implementation

Go long when there is an increase in the fair value of liabilities within a year and short when the opposite occurs.

Hints to Implement

Could observing the increase over a shorter period improve accuracy?
